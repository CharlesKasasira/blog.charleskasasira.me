Today was the 8th of December. celebrating my 22nd anniversary. and for my wish (goal) in this new year, **I wish to** share my knowledge and experience to create empowered communities. this is my personal statement and I was helped to formulate it by the help of my Coach after looking at what was of most value to me and what I had to offer.

**
The #1 required skill for today and the future is community building because no one will accomplish much anymore by themselves.**


**How do you share your experience as a young man?**

22 is not quite a lot of experience and I have just finished my Full-stack cohort. what can I share? There is no such thing as too little information to share and I should always put myself out there to share, I have to hold myself accountable and make decisions about safely sharing my unique experience with others through practicing writing and speaking. I do believe that everyone has stories that when told right can help others to achieve specific goals plus it expands what I know.
